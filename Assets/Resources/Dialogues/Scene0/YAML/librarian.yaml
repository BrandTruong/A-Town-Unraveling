- Librarian: What can I do for you today detective?

  		- What can you tell me about the town?
      - Librarian: Well, it’s a quiet town. Not much really happens here except recently.
      - Librarian: You’ve seen the news. The murders and such. It’s a real Tragedy.

  		- How have there been so many killings linked to the library?
      - Librarian: The library has many events ya’ see, and I like to let those events go a little late.
      - Librarian: So, I give a couple people keys to the library so they can lock up after they are done.
      - Player: Don’t you think that is dangerous? The murderer could be using their key to get in and kill people!
      - Librarian: I have cut down on the number of people I have given a key to. Now only the heads of different groups have keys. 
      - Librarian: Not only that, but now events can’t go past 10:00 PM.
			- Librarian: For safety, ya’ know.

        - Who is that boy in the corner down there?
        - Librarian: I believe that’s Gary. Weird little kid he is.
        - Player: What do you mean?
        - Librarian: Well, he is always off by himself. Doesn’t talk to other kids his age that much.
        - Player: That’s not that uncommon?
        - Librarian: I don’t know how to put this exactly, but he’s just not like the other kids. Doesn’t have a girlfriend, is part of the chess club, but I never see him play. And I don’t think I ever see him eat or drink.
        - Librarian: Is there anything else you wanna ask?
        - EOD: EOD

        - Who are the men playing chess?
        - Librarian: Well, the one losing is Joey, not too much to say about Joey.
        - Librarian: But the one winning, that’s…. well…. I’m not sure what his name is.
        - Player: Do you know anything about him?
        - Librarian: Well, he showed up in town about a month or two ago. I don’t know where he lives, but he always shows up for chess events.
        - Librarian: He used to have big fights with the previous chess club leader,  Charles, God rest his soul.
        - Player: Would these fights ever get physical?
        - Librarian: I don’t think so, but Charles would always beat the new boy you saw. And, he wasn’t exactly a good winner. If you catch my drift.
        - Librarian: One could tell that the boy downstairs resented Charles for his attitude.
        - Librarian: But that new boy has only ever been really nice to me. I can’t even imagine he could do something as horrible as kill Charles for something like that. Do you?
        - Player: I’m not sure ma'am, I’ve seen people do some pretty dark things. 
        - EOD: EOD
